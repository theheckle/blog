I haven’t heard of a stepper motor before, but it felt similar to using a rotary encoder. It was interesting seeing the breakdown of a stepper motor and how it is a series of magnets.\n<a href=\"https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/videos/videos-transistors-and-motors/#Stepper_Motors\">videos</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Week 10 Lab","date":"November 17, 2020","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/physical-computing/assignment-7/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/animation/assignment-3/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Project 1 Part 2"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/physical-computing/project-3-idea/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Project 3 Idea"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
