I tried following the first library, and was having difficulties. I tried using this <a href=\"https://maker.pro/arduino/tutorial/how-to-use-the-arduino-nano-33-bles-built-in-imu\">second tutorial</a> and had issues with using both the <code class=\"language-text\">Serial</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">IMU</code> parts of the library. After more soul searching, I found this <a href=\"https://desertbot.io/blog/arduino-nano-33-iot-imu\">other tutorial</a> which actually used the first library. As it turns out, however, I didn’t need this at all for the first lab…</p>\n<h1>Intro to Asynchronous Serial Communications</h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lab-intro-to-serial-communications/\">first lab</a> brought little trouble.</p>\n<h1>Serial Input to P5.js</h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/labs-serial-communication/lab-serial-input-to-the-p5-js-ide/\">second lab</a></p>\n<p>Following the tutorial I was able to get the sensor value printing to the screen. It took me a few tries — I was using the wrong input value for my analog read, my output wire was connected to ground instead of the output, and I had problems with the code (I restarted and went through more carefully). After all this, I finally printed out the sensor value:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/blog/static/5f223f52c3bd5311a39f3e68cc890c65/0f98f/sensor_value.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"sensor value\"\n        title=\"sensor value\"\n        src=\"/blog/static/5f223f52c3bd5311a39f3e68cc890c65/1c72d/sensor_value.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/blog/static/5f223f52c3bd5311a39f3e68cc890c65/a80bd/sensor_value.jpg 148w,\n/blog/static/5f223f52c3bd5311a39f3e68cc890c65/1c91a/sensor_value.jpg 295w,\n/blog/static/5f223f52c3bd5311a39f3e68cc890c65/1c72d/sensor_value.jpg 590w,\n/blog/static/5f223f52c3bd5311a39f3e68cc890c65/a8a14/sensor_value.jpg 885w,\n/blog/static/5f223f52c3bd5311a39f3e68cc890c65/fbd2c/sensor_value.jpg 1180w,\n/blog/static/5f223f52c3bd5311a39f3e68cc890c65/0f98f/sensor_value.jpg 1920w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>And with the addition of the graphing function I was able to get the pentiometer graph working as well!\n<img src=\"/blog/4ba01b9af6f07bd2f962154a7b7df839/graph.gif\" alt=\"graph\"></p>\n<h1>Serial output from P5.js</h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/labs-serial-communication/lab-serial-output-from-p5-js/\">third lab</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Week 6 Labs","date":"October 18, 2020","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/physical-computing/assignment-4/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/visual-language/assignment-5/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Week 7 Logo"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
