Keeping the comic format made the academic writing easier to digest because it was easy to visualize the concepts presented. </p>\n<p>One of the most striking concepts is the conversation around cartoons are the embodiment of “me” or “I” injected into the story. I personally don’t have a ton of exposure to comics &#x26; manga, but I definitely find myself trying to identify with characters in novels. This was slightly more challenging with a comic because I don’t necessarily identify with the character that was presenting the information. But, knowing that it is my voice hearing the words my perspective changed slightly. Because the concepts were presented in a story-like manner, I was learning along with the avatar. On top of that, this brings a whole extra layer to “self-learning”, learning new content from “yourself” idenifying as the teacher in the comic. </p>\n<h2>Personal Notes from Reading</h2>\n<h1>How to Define Comics</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Will Eisner - Sequential Art </li>\n<li>How to seperate form from content and how the content is delivered</li>\n<li>\n<p>what is the form? more specific juxtaposed sequential visual art</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dictionary definition of juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>comics vs cartoons (one panel)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Vocab</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>icons - images to represent a person place thing or idea</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cartoon is icon (lol at disney blackout)</li>\n<li>abstracting the face — we never see our own face but now in the day of zoom it is hard to not see our faces all the time</li>\n<li>cartoons become the embodiment of “I” as a concept because reading especially is bringing to life something that wouldn’t otherwise</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>pictures = received info</li>\n<li>writing = perceived info</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Blood in the Gutter</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Senses can only reveal a world that is fragmented and incomplete</li>\n<li>\n<p>closure = observing the parts be perceiving the whole</p>\n<ul>\n<li>comics must use closure more often - primary means of simulating time and motion</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Transitions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moment to moment - little closure, shows actions frame by frame</li>\n<li>Action to action - single subject</li>\n<li>subject to subject - reader involvement</li>\n<li>scene to scene - transfer between time and space</li>\n<li>aspect to aspect</li>\n<li>non sequitur</li>\n<li>2-4 show things happening in concise efficient ways</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>west vs. east transitions </p>\n<ul>\n<li>east uses more type 5 because of tradition of cyclical and labrynthine works of art</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Time Frames</h1>\n<p>panel is most important comic icon</p>\n<h1>Show and Tell</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Words used to be pictures but now are sound only. </li>\n<li>evolution of language to more direct, like pictures</li>\n<li>\n<p>combinations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>word specific— pictures illustrate but don’t add to complete text</li>\n<li>picture specific — words add only soundtrack</li>\n<li>duo-specific— words and pictures tell the same message</li>\n<li>additive— words amplify message</li>\n<li>parallel — words and pictures follow very different courses</li>\n<li>montage — words are a part of the picture</li>\n<li>\n<p>interdependent— words and picutres go hand in hand</p>\n<ul>\n<li>can have a specturum between words and pictures</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>the six steps</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>definition of art — doesn’t grow out of survival or reproduction</li>\n<li>creativity follows 6 steps\nidea / purpose = content\nform = medium (book, chair, drawing etc)\nidiom = genre belongs to\nstructure = how to compose work\ncraft = constructing work, applying skills\nsurface = production value, finishing </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>a word about color</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>dependent on commerce and techonology</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Understanding Comics","date":"November 04, 2020","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/animation/assignment-2/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/animation/assignment-1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"First Stop Motion"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/physical-computing/project-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Project 2"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
