I toyed around with lots of different shapes but I figured, hey since it is a pink sticky not I should do something that is traditionally pink. I followed this basic theme of a heart and had multiple different cut-outs of what I thought I wanted to achieve.</p>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n<p>I also had issues with my tripod — I ended up having to jury rig a phone mount from the tripod that I currently had.</p>\n<p>I also had issues using stop motion pro on my desktop computer and my camera unfortunately was not supported. I ended up getting the free version on my phone.</p>\n<h2>Theme</h2>\n<p>I wanted to have a theme of looping gifs that could work together to tell a story. This resulted in my two loops titled <code class=\"language-text\">Broken</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">Together</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/d424f5ba65a4dedcad9a25d0081061a8/broken1.gif\" alt=\"broken\">\n<img src=\"/blog/172ffffc47476164b092d01f1bf43757/love.gif\" alt=\"together\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"First Stop Motion","date":"November 02, 2020","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/animation/assignment-1/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/physical-computing/project-2-idea/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Project 2 Idea"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/animation/assignment-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Understanding Comics"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
